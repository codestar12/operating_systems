## Chapter 5
### Process Synchronization

#### Objectives
- critical section problem
- hardware and software solutions

---

#### Background

- Processes can be executed concurrently
	* may be interrupted at any time, partially completing execution

- Concurrent access to shared data may result in data inconsistency

- Critical section do not allow multiple access to data

solution to critical-section problem

1. Mutual Exclusion - if prcess P_i is executing in its critical section, then no other processes can be executing in their critical sections

2. Progress - If no process is executing in its critical section and there exist some process that wish to enter their critical section, then the selection of the processes that will enter the crictical section next cannot be postponed indefinitely

3. Bounded Waiting - a bound must exist on the number of times that other processes are allowed to enter their critical sections after a process has made a request to enter its critical section and before that request is granted.

## Hardware solutions

### Peterson's Solution

- Two process solution

- Assume that ```load``` and ```store``` instructions are atomic

- The two process share two variables:
	* int turn;
	* boolean flag[2]

P<sub>i</sub>'s code
```cpp

do {
	flag[i] = true;
	turn = j;
	while (flag[j] && turn == j);
		// critical section
	flag[i] = false;
		// remainder section
} while(true);
```

P<sub>j</sub>'s code
```cpp

do{
	flag[j] = true;
	turn = i;
	while(flag[i] && turn==i);
		//critical section
	flag[j] = false;
		//remainder section
} while(True);

```

----

#### Solution using locks

```cpp

do{
	aquire lock;
		// critical section;
	release lock;
		// rest;
}while(true)
```

```cpp

boolean test_and_set (boolean* target){
	boolean rv = *target;
	*target = TRUE;
	return rv;
}

do{
	while(test_and_set(&lock)); /* do nothing */
	// execute critical section
	lock = false;
	// execute remainder section
}while(true)
```

## Software solution

### Semaphore with Busy waiting

- Synchronization tool that does not require busy waiting
- Semaphore S - integer variable
- Two standard operations modify S: wait() and signal ()

- Binary semaphore mutex lock

#### Bounded Buffer Problem

Init: mutex 1;
value: empty 5; full 0;

```cpp
do{
	/// produce an item in next_produced
	wait(empty);
	wait(mutex);
	// add next produced to the buffer
	signal(mutex);
	signal(full);
} while(true);


### Deadlock and Starvatoin
- Deadlock - two or more processes are waiting indefinitely for an event that can be caused by only one of the waiting processes

- Starvation - indefinite blocking
	* A process may never be removed from the semaphore queue in which it is suspended
- Priority Inversion - Scheduling problem when lower-priotrie process hold a lock needed by higher priority process
	* Solved via priority-inheritance protocal
		- temporaraly raise the priority of the process with the lock
